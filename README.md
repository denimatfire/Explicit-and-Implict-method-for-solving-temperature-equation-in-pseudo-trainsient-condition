# Explicit-and-Implict-method-for-solving-temperature-equation-in-pseudo-trainsient-condition
pseudo-transient solution approach for two materials (copper and stainless steel) with initial condition of temperature
Explicit method: FTCS
Implicit method
a) BTCS: Point Gauss-Seidel iterative method
b) ADI: Line Gauss-Seidel iterative method (TriDiagonal Matrix Algorithm)
c) Optional: You may try (a) and (b) with over relaxation.
